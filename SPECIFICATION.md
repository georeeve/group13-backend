# Grocery Website

The project is to create a grocery website which will display a list of items and their categories. Visitors will be able to filter items based on item category. Customers will be able to create accounts with their delivery information. Users will then be able to add items to their basket and checkout while being able to select a delivery slot. The item quantities will then update based on each sale. For an extension task, administrators will be able to update items and item quantities through an administrator dashboard.
